# FusioMR: Simulation and Data Analysis Code

This repository contains the full set of R scripts used for the simulation studies and real-data analyses presented in the FusioMR manuscript. 

* The codebase is organized to support transparency, reproducibility, and easy adaptation for related Mendelian Randomization (MR) workflows. These scripts serve as templates for applying FusioMR to new datasets or extending the model design.

* The codes require R version ≥ 4.2.1. Dependencies are listed at the top of each R script.

* Folder `Functions`: data generation and utility functions used in simulation and real data analysis.

* Before running any code, update all file paths in the scripts to match your local directory structure.

* Codes are largely self-explained.
*
* If you have any quesions, encounter issues, or would like to discuss methodological extensions, feel free to open an issue in this repository or contact Bowei Kang at kbw@uchicago.edu.
